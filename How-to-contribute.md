### Reporting a bug
Please do not hesitate to log an issue: 

* First check if the problem is not yet referenced in the project issues (https://github.com/shinken-monitoring/mod-webui/issues)
* Create an issue with: 

   - an helpful title - use descriptive keywords in the title and body so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates).
   - a precise description - steps to reproduce the problem, with actual vs. expected results
   - specifify : WebUI Version, OS version, Web browser and version

* If the problem happens with specific code, link to test files (gist.github.com is a great place to upload code).

> Screenshots are very helpful if you're seeing an error message or a UI display problem. (Just drag an image into the issue description field to include it).
