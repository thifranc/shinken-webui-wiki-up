Upgrading from WebUI version 1 is made really easy. Proceed to the new Web UI installation as [explained on this page](https://github.com/shinken-monitoring/mod-webui/wiki/Installation) but do not restart Shinken after installation is completed.

Notes:
* Remove `auth-cfg-password` and `mongodb` from webui modules.
